# JALCoreDataStack
Implementation of a Core Data stack that uses a child main queue context and a parent private queue context.

The stack can be initialized with an in-memory store for running XCTests.

A bare bones recipe example is included with a table view using NSFetchedResultsController. This project is also being used as an experiment in styling the UITableView. It is currently experimental and by no means complete.

Recent experiment: styling the tableView cell as a rounded card. Eventually this card can be clicked on to expand the full view.
